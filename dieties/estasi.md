# Estasi

While the influences of Life, Chaos, and Dream are still clearly present. These
Ancient Gods have long been forgotten in the mortal planes.

The Pantheon of Azzura, however, are widely known and worshipped. They gain
their name from the blue mood of Aern that it is said they live on. It is the
azzurium of Azzura that connect the Estasi to this location, however they were
born from the ancient magic of [Inizio](/inizio). Some Estasi have a direct
connection to one of the ancient dieties, like John and Dream, but most get
their divine power being a creature of Inizio.

## The Pantheon of Azzura

### Vivere The Forger - Master of the Life Forge

Vivere built the world and created intelligent life. He is worshipped by smiths
in particular and seen as leader of the Estasi.

### Caccia The Hunter - Goddess of Death

Where Vivere is the start, Caccia is the end.
It is said that on your deathbed, Caccia's arrow comes with your final breath,
and you will be taken to the afterlife. She is worshipped by hunters and those
who seek to understand death, but she is not loved the way Vivere is.

### Suolo The Wanderer - Protective Nature Spirit

Navigator of the afterlife, Suolo is the protector of souls.
Also knows as The Guide, she is said to help souls find their way to the
afterlife and protect them from harm. She is prayed to by travelers and their
families to provide safe passage and protection on their journeys. She will
often be depicted as an animal, such as a wolf or a bird, in religious art.
Stories are told of how Suolo in animal form has appeared to travelers in need,
guiding them to safety or providing comfort in times of distress. More often she
will come after death, guiding souls to the spirit realm.

### Dati The Scholar - Keeper of Lore

Dati recorded the history of the world and the knowledge of the gods. He is
worshipped by scholars. His endless study is filled with all of Aerns events and
history, no matter how small.

### John The Painter - Vessel of Dream

John is a direct conduit of Dream, the Ancient, which has driven him insane. 
John channels Dream through his art, painting images inside peoples minds,
allowing them to see visions from the Ancient with some mental protection from
the madness.

John is worshipped by artists who believe him to be a muse, but the few who have
communicated with him have found a tortmented soul who is trapped in a cycle of
madness.

### Admiral Vela - The Stormbringer

The Admiral is a powerful figure in the Estasi pantheon, known for her control
over storms and the seas. She is often depicted as a fierce warrior, battling
against the chaotic forces of the sea, though it is widely agreed that she is
able to calm them on command.

A captain of a ship that sails under no flag may dedicate their ship to Vela,
and she may then show mercy on their voyages. Many pirates use Vela's flag to
prove themselves to be under her protection, or that they remain honerable.

### Vittoria The Conqueror - Warrior of Azzura

Vittoria is one of two war gods in the Estasi pantheon, and is often depicted as
a fierce and ruthless warrior. Vittoria values strength and victory above all
else, granting her the following of many tribes and mercenaries, looking to
expand their territory or to wipe out an enemy.

### Cavali The Defender - The Shield of Azzura

Cavali is the second war god, often reffered to as The Knight as a sign of
respect. He is the protector of the weak and the defender of kingdoms. He is
worshipped by soldiers who who value honour and loyalty over glory. He is often
depicted as a noble knight, standing guard over the people.

### Tossire The Healer - Preserver of Life

Tossire is the goddess of healing and medicine, often depicted as a gentle and
compassionate figure. Her symbol is used to mark places of healing. Some stories
have been told of Tossire herself appearing to heal the sick or injured.

### Perfetto The Kind - Health, Hearth, Heart

Perfetto is the goddess of all things domestic. She blesses all things from
marriage to daily meals. Any firepit or hearth used for cooking can be dedicated
to Perfetto to become an alter for her name. It is common to dedicate a meal to
Perfetto, giving thanks for the food and the company.

Raccolto blesses the harvest and the fertility of the land. He is worshipped by
farmers but many others will give thanks to him when preparing meals.

### Venditrice The Merchant - Patron of Commerce

ask Venditrice for good fortune before a big deal, or when sending a shipment
they will seal it with his symbol. This signifies to theives that the shipment
is under Venditrice's protection, and that if he has truely blessed it then it
is not worth the risk to steal from.

### Inno The Tinkerer - Master of Invention

Inno is a muse to all inventors, the inspiration behind innovation. He will
never make an invention work when the laws of the universe say it shouldn't, but
he will inspire inventors to find a way and he may amend the laws if the
invention is of particular interest to him. He is worshipped by inventors and
engineers.
Inno is credited with the inventioin of time but really he just improved it.

scales in their favour.

### Cielo The Traveller - The Messenger of the Gods

Cielo watches over all that leaves the ground, from the smallest of insects to
the largest of airships. It is said that the dragons on Aern were created by
Vivere in Cielos image.


## History

### Early

In the early days of Aern the Estasi were more active in the mortal planes. They
would often interact with the people, teaching them many valuable skills and
offering help to those who followed their teachings. The Estasi would often take
particular interest in a certain individual and they would become their patron
deity, offering them guidance and connection to their magic. This period was a
time of hero's and legends, with many stories of the Estasi's interacions with
the people of Aern.

### Arcane Revolution

Following Aerns industrialisation, the Estasi were no longer needed to teach
people as they became more self-sufficient, and they began to fade into the
background. This was a time of great expansion, towns were built up in to
cities, and the world became more connected. The arcane revolution grew out of
this industrialisation as people began to experiment with magic in new ways.
Technomancy was born, and they began to pull magic from the world around them,
storing it in gems of azzurium. The Estasi were not happy with this as they had
not granted this power like they would in the past, and they began to withdraw
themselves from the mortal planes. 

### Modern Day

The Abandonment of the Estasi was cataclysmic for the world. The power of the
gods was what kept the world stable. Without them the lands shifted and the seas
rose, causing widespread destruction. The experiments of the technomancers only
made things worse - though they had succeeded in creating these connections
between azzurium gems and magical energy - they pulled in realms they didn't
know existed, and with it the people from these realms came to Aern.

The technologies of the past have long been lost, and the world has been
reshaped by the abandonment of the Estasi. The people of Aern have had to adapt
to a world without the gods, however as they return to their roots the Estasi
are beginning to return to their world.
