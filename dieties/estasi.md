# Estasi

While the influences of Life, Chaos, and Dream are still clearly present. These Ancient Gods have long been forgotten in the mortal planes.

The Pantheon of Azzura, however, are widely known and worshipped by many.

### Vivery The Forger - Master of the Life Forge

Vivere built the world and created intelligent life. He is worshipped by smiths in particular and seen as leader of the Estasi.

### Caccia The Hunter - Goddess of Death

Where Vivere is the start, Caccia is the end.
It is said that on your deathbed, Caccia's arrow comes with your final breath,
and you will be taken to the afterlife. She is worshipped by hunters and those
who seek to understand death, but she is not loved the way Vivere is.

### Suolo the Wanderer - Protective Nature Spirit

Navigator of the afterlife, Suolo is the protector of souls.
Also knows as The Guide, she is said to help souls find their way to the
afterlife and protect them from harm. She is prayed to by travelers and their
families to provide safe passage and protection on their journeys. She will
often be depicted as an animal, such as a wolf or a bird, in religious art.
Stories are told of how Suolo in animal form has appeared to travelers in need,
guiding them to safety or providing comfort in times of distress. More often she
will come after death, guiding souls to the spirit realm.

### Dati the Scholar - Keeper of Lore

Dati recorded the history of the world and the knowledge of the gods. He is
worshipped by scholars. His endless study is filled with all of Aerns events and
history, no matter how small.

### John the Painter - Vessel of Dream

John is a direct conduit of Dream, the Ancient, which has driven him insane. 
John channels Dream through his art, painting images inside peoples minds,
allowing them to see visions from the Ancient with some mental protection from
the madness.

John is worshipped by artists who believe him to be a muse, but the few who have
communicated with him have found a tortmented soul who is trapped in a cycle of
madness.

### Admiral Vela - The Stormbringer

The Admiral is a powerful figure in the Estasi pantheon, known for her control
over storms and the seas. She is often depicted as a fierce warrior, battling
against the chaotic forces of the sea, though it is widely agreed that she is
able to calm them on command.

A captain of a ship that sails under no flag may dedicate their ship to Vela,
and she may then show mercy on their voyages. Many pirates use Vela's flag to
prove themselves to be under her protection, or that they remain honerable.
